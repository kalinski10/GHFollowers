first fully optimised and completed app, created 100% programatically.

This is an app is from a course I followed by Sean Allen, where he explains and teaches how to build an industry level app.

The app is relatively simple it consist of 5 screens and the premise is that you have an app where you type in a github username and it fetches their followers.
You can then add that follower to favourites or you click on one of their followers and pull thier info.

Technologies and techniques I learned and used in this course:
  1. Diffable Data Source
  2. CollectionViews
  3. TableViews
  4. Parent - Child VC's
  5. Sublcassing
  6. Protocols and Delegates
  7. API calls
  8. SafariServices
  9. Date formating
  10. Threading and Concurrency
  11. MVC architecture model
  12. Tab Controlller
  13. Navigation Controller
  14. write clean and well documented code while keeping consistency
  15. adjust elements to fit on all screen sizes
  16. Light and dark mode
  17. Empty state views
  18. custom alerts
  19. SearchBar Controller
